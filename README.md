# Sprint Board Lite

A modern, responsive sprint board application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Live Demo

[Deployed on Vercel](https://your-project.vercel.app)

## 📋 Features Implemented

### Core Requirements ✅

- **Authentication**: Mock auth system with localStorage token management
- **Board Management**: Three-column kanban board (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Drag & Drop**: Smooth drag and drop between columns with visual feedback
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with automatic rollback on API failures
- **Search & Filter**: Client-side search by title and filter by priority
- **Create Tasks**: Modal for creating new tasks with title, description, and priority
- **Dark Mode**: Persistent dark mode with localStorage
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design, mobile-first approach
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for errors with rollback indication

### Variant Implementation

Choose based on first letter of your name:

- **A-G: Undo Move** ✅ - 5-second undo toast after moving tasks
- **H-P: Keyboard Navigation** ✅ - Use [ and ] keys to move focused tasks
- **Q-Z: Offline Queue** - Queue writes when offline (partial implementation)

_Current implementation includes both Undo and Keyboard variants for demonstration_

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (CSS animations used in demo)
- **State Management**: React Context + useState
- **API**: Mock API with simulated failures (10% failure rate)

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sprint-board-lite.git
cd sprint-board-lite
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Run the mock API server:

```bash
npm run mock-api
```

5. In another terminal, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### 1. Optimistic Updates

- Immediate UI feedback for better UX
- Automatic rollback on API failures
- Visual indicators for pending/failed operations

### 2. State Management

- React Context for auth and theme (global state)
- Local component state for tasks (could scale to Redux/Zustand)
- Custom hooks for separation of concerns

### 3. Error Handling

- 10% simulated failure rate for testing
- Toast notifications with action buttons
- Graceful fallbacks and error boundaries

### 4. Performance

- Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- Debounced search input
- Memoized expensive computations
- Code splitting with dynamic imports

### 5. Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management
- High contrast mode support

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm test:coverage
```
